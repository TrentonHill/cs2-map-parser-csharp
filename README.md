# .net 4.8 C# CS2 Map Parser

Converts .vphys files into a .tri format, which consists of a list of vec3 points, every three points represent a single triangle!

This approach is used because parsing .vphys files directly with VK3 Parser consumes a significant amount of memory (e.g., the Inferno map is ~5.9â€¯GB) and contains a lot of unnecessary data. Converting to .tri reduces memory usage and speeds up the process of using these vectors in your code.
